# Crazy.Cards.Web
Crazy Cards . Live demo :

To use the application  , go to the Cards Tab , fill in the information and click Show cards.

You can edit the customer/user info by clicking the Edit button on the right hand panel.

This website has been made using Angular JS as the front end and ASP.NET Web API 2 as back end.

The front end uses  
- Bootstrap ( Free 'Freelancer' theme)
- Angular JS for client side MVC
- Angular JS UI-Router to implement the front end website as a single page application.


Backend 
- Uses Web API 
- Uses repository pattern to implement the Data layer.
- Uses a in memory repository implementation.
- Uses concepts of Domain Driven Design . Backens project is seperated in Core , Data and the API infrastructure projects.
- Uses structure map for Dependency injection ( although at this point it is probably a overkill )



To run the application locally ,download the app and open using Visual Studio 2015.
